# ☕ OOPS-in-JAVA

This repository covers core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Java, including lab exercises, assignment solutions, and hands-on projects. It's organized to help learners study and apply OOP principles systematically.

## 📁 Repository Structure

---

## 🧪 Lab Files (`Labs`)

Contains Java programs covering essential OOP concepts:

- Classes & Objects
- Constructors (default, parameterized, chaining)
- Method Overloading & Overriding
- Inheritance & `super` keyword
- Polymorphism (compile-time & runtime)
- Encapsulation & access modifiers
- Abstraction (abstract classes, interfaces)
- Inner/nested classes (static, local, anonymous)
- Exception handling (`try`, `catch`, `finally`)
- Multithreading & synchronization
- Static import, `this` & `super` keyword usage

Labs include practical examples and inline comments for clarity.

---

## 📚 Assignments (`Assignments/`)

Explore Java assignments that reinforce theoretical understanding:

- Custom constructor implementations
- Method resolution (overloading vs overriding)
- Reference vs value passing
- Creation of basic utilities and class hierarchies
- Threading behavior and exception flow

These solutions are well-structured, modular, and documented for learning.
